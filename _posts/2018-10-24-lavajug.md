description:
  We’ve just deployed a shinny new set of micro-services and it behaves in a
  strange manner. Hard to say why with so many moving parts… Let’s leverage the
  newly installed service mesh to understand what we’ve deployed, find the root
  problem, fix it with a bandaid and then do a proper, non trivial, blue-green
  deployment of a v2. That will involve the Service Graph, Prometheus
  monitoring, Grafana Dashboards, Traffic mirroring, all orchestrated in a
  simple manner by Istio.
